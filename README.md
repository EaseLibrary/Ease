# Ease Library

Ease is a .Net library to ease unit testing through IoC containers and Mocking.

Ease is built on top of [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit) & [Moq](https://github.com/moq) and currently supports [DryIoc](https://github.com/dadhi/DryIoc) & [Unity](https://github.com/unitycontainer) IoC containers and has extensions with some basic support for [Prism.Forms](https://github.com/prismlibrary).

Our philosiphy is to embrace the magic of DI and the IoC containers that we are already using in our app development to make testing easier to write and manage.
